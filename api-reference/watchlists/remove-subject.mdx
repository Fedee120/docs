## Important Notes

<Info>
  **What Happens After Removal**
  
  When a subject is removed from a watchlist:
  - The subject is immediately excluded from future checks
  - Historical screening data for this subject is preserved
  - No alerts will be sent for this subject
  - The subject can be re-added later if needed
</Info>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Get Subject ID First">
    To remove a subject, you need their `subject_id`. Get it from the [Get Watchlist](/api-reference/watchlists/get) endpoint which returns all subjects with their IDs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Preserve Audit Trail">
    Before removing subjects, export watchlist data for compliance and audit purposes using the [Get Watchlist](/api-reference/watchlists/get) endpoint.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Batch Operations">
    Currently, subjects must be removed one at a time. If you need to remove many subjects, consider [deleting](/api-reference/watchlists/delete) and recreating the watchlist or pausing it.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Workflow

Get subject IDs, then remove:

```bash
# Step 1: Get watchlist details to find subject_id
curl -X GET https://stg.kyc.legaltalent.ai/kyc/watchlists/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Response includes subjects array with subject_id values
# {
#   "subjects": [
#     {"subject_id": "660e8400-...", "full_name": "John Doe"},
#     {"subject_id": "770e8400-...", "full_name": "Jane Smith"}
#   ]
# }

# Step 2: Remove specific subject
curl -X DELETE https://stg.kyc.legaltalent.ai/kyc/watchlists/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/subjects/660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Next Steps

- [Add new subjects](/api-reference/watchlists/add-subjects) to replace removed ones
- [Get watchlist details](/api-reference/watchlists/get) to verify removal
- [Update watchlist](/api-reference/watchlists/update) configuration if needed
