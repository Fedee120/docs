## What are Watchlists?

Watchlists provide continuous monitoring of entities (persons or organizations) against sanctions lists, enabling automated compliance screening over time. Instead of performing one-time checks, watchlists automatically re-screen subjects at configured intervals and alert you when matches are found or status changes occur.

## Key Features

  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-List Monitoring" icon="layer-group">

</CardGroup>

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Customer Onboarding
Create a watchlist for new customers during onboarding. Continue monitoring throughout the customer lifecycle.

### 2. Vendor Due Diligence
Monitor vendors and suppliers continuously to detect sanction changes that could impact your business.

### 3. Employee Screening
Maintain watchlists for employees in sensitive positions with automated periodic rescreening.

### 4. Ongoing Compliance
Meet regulatory requirements for continuous monitoring of high-risk individuals and entities.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Watchlist">
    Create a watchlist and configure monitoring parameters (check frequency, alert settings, lists to monitor).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Subjects">
    Add one or more subjects (persons/organizations) to the watchlist with identifying information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Screening">
    The system automatically screens all subjects at the configured frequency (daily, weekly, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Alerts">
    Get notified via webhook or email when matches are found or statuses change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Access detailed screening results and historical data for compliance reporting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Check Frequencies

| Frequency | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Daily** | Screen all subjects once per day | High-risk entities, regulatory requirements |
| **Weekly** | Screen all subjects once per week | Standard monitoring, lower-risk entities |
| **On Update** | Only screen when subjects are added/modified | Static lists, manual control |

## Alert Configuration

Configure how you want to be notified when events occur:

```json
{
  "alert_config": {
    "on_new_match": true,
    "on_status_change": true,
    "webhook_url": "https://your-server.com/webhooks/kyc",
    "notification_email": "compliance@example.com"
  }
}
```

### Alert Types

- **New Match**: Triggered when a subject matches a watchlist for the first time
- **Status Change**: Triggered when a subject's match status changes (e.g., added to sanctions list)

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose Appropriate Frequency">
    - Use **daily** checks for high-risk entities or regulatory requirements
    - Use **weekly** checks for standard monitoring to reduce costs
    - Use **on_update** for static lists where changes are rare
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Configure Alerts Properly">
    - Set up webhook endpoints that can handle POST requests
    - Implement retry logic for webhook failures
    - Monitor email notifications to avoid missing critical alerts
    - Test webhooks before going to production
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Organize by Risk Level">
    Create separate watchlists for different risk categories:
    - High-risk customers (daily monitoring)
    - Standard customers (weekly monitoring)
    - Vendors (weekly monitoring)
    - Employees (monthly or on-update)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Batch Operations">
    When adding multiple subjects, use batch endpoints to:
    - Reduce API calls and stay within rate limits
    - Improve performance
    - Simplify error handling
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor Usage">
    Track your watchlist activity with the Usage API to:
    - Understand screening volumes
    - Optimize check frequencies
    - Manage costs
    - Plan capacity
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Webhook Payload

When alerts are triggered, your webhook endpoint receives a POST request:

```json
{
  "event_type": "watchlist.match.found",
  "watchlist_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "watchlist_name": "High Risk Customers",
  "subject": {
    "subject_id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "identifier": "12345678"
  },
  "matches": [
    {
      "list_name": "ofac",
      "entity_id": "12345",
      "confidence_score": 0.95,
      "programs": ["SDGT"]
    }
  ],
  "checked_at": "2024-11-22T09:00:00Z"
}
```

## Pricing Considerations

Watchlist monitoring costs are based on:
- Number of watchlists (no limit)
- Number of subjects per watchlist
- Check frequency (daily checks = 30Ã— monthly volume)
- Number of lists monitored per subject

Use the [Usage API](/api-reference/usage) to track your consumption and optimize costs.
