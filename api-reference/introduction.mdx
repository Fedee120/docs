## Welcome

The KYC API provides comprehensive compliance screening for sanctions lists, PEPs (Politically Exposed Persons), and adverse media. Built for financial institutions, fintech companies, and any business requiring KYC/AML compliance.

## Environments

The API is available in two client-accessible environments:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Staging" icon="flask">
    **Base URL**: `https://stg.kyc.legaltalent.ai`
    
    - Testing and integration development
    - Same features as production
    - Safe environment for experimentation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Production" icon="rocket">
    **Base URL**: `https://kyc.legaltalent.ai`
    
    - Live operations
    - Production-grade SLAs
    - Full monitoring and alerting
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  Always use **Staging** for development and testing. Only use **Production** URLs with production credentials for live operations.
</Warning>

## Base URLs

| Environment | API Base URL |
|------------|--------------|
| **Staging** | `https://stg.kyc.legaltalent.ai` |
| **Production** | `https://kyc.legaltalent.ai` |

## Rate Limiting

The API is protected by AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) with intelligent rate limiting to ensure service availability and prevent abuse.

### Rate Limits

<Info>
  **Current Limit**: 1,000 requests per 5 minutes per IP address
</Info>

Rate limits apply per source IP address and are enforced at both Staging and Production environments.

#### Rate Limit Details

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Requests per window** | 1,000 |
| **Time window** | 5 minutes (300 seconds) |
| **Enforcement** | Per IP address |
| **Response when exceeded** | `429 Too Many Requests` |

#### Rate Limit Headers

Responses include rate limit information in headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 847
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1732278600
```

#### Rate Limit Response

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "Too many requests. Please try again in 3 minutes.",
  "retry_after": 180
}
```

**HTTP Status**: `429 Too Many Requests`

### Best Practices for Rate Limits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement Exponential Backoff">
    When you receive a `429` response, implement exponential backoff:
    
    ```python
    import time
    
    def make_request_with_backoff(url, max_retries=3):
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            response = requests.post(url, ...)
            if response.status_code != 429:
                return response
            
            # Exponential backoff: 2^attempt seconds
            wait_time = 2 ** attempt
            time.sleep(wait_time)
        
        raise Exception("Rate limit exceeded after retries")
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Batch Requests Efficiently">
    Use multi-list checks instead of multiple single-list requests:
    
    **❌ Inefficient** (3 requests):
    ```bash
    POST /kyc { "list_name": "ofac" }
    POST /kyc { "list_name": "un" }
    POST /kyc { "list_name": "eu" }
    ```
    
    **✅ Efficient** (1 request):
    ```bash
    POST /kyc { "lists": ["ofac", "un", "eu"] }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor Usage Metrics">
    Track your usage with the Usage API to stay within limits:
    
    ```bash
    GET /kyc/usage?granularity=hour
    ```
    
    Set up alerts when approaching 80% of your rate limit.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Distribute Load">
    For high-volume integrations:
    - Spread requests evenly over time
    - Avoid burst patterns at start of 5-minute windows
    - Plan your integration to stay within rate limits
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Need Higher Limits?

If your use case requires higher rate limits, contact your account manager to discuss enterprise plans with:
- Custom rate limits
- Dedicated infrastructure
- SLA guarantees
- Priority support

## WAF Protection

In addition to rate limiting, the API is protected by AWS WAF with:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="OWASP Top 10 Protection" icon="shield-check">
    Protection against common web attacks including SQL injection, XSS, and remote code execution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DDoS Mitigation" icon="shield-halved">
    Automatic detection and blocking of distributed denial-of-service attacks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Geo-Filtering" icon="globe">
    Optional geographic restrictions for enhanced security.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bot Protection" icon="robot">
    Intelligent filtering of automated traffic and malicious bots.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using Bearer tokens. See the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/auth) for details on:

- JWT tokens for user applications
- API keys for server-to-server integrations
- Permission model and RBAC
- Token management best practices
