title: 'Health Check'
api: 'GET /health'
---

The health check endpoint provides a quick way to verify that the KYC API service is running and responsive.

## Endpoint

```
GET /health
```

## Authentication

No authentication required. This endpoint is publicly accessible for monitoring purposes.

## Description

This endpoint performs a basic liveness check without verifying external dependencies. It responds quickly (< 100ms) and is suitable for:
- Load balancer health checks
- Service monitoring
- Deployment verification
- Uptime monitoring

**Note**: This endpoint does not check database connectivity or external services. For deep health checks including dependencies, use the readiness endpoint (internal use only).

## Request Example

<RequestExample>
```bash
curl https://dev.kyc.legaltalent.ai/health
```
</RequestExample>

## Response Format

### Success Response

<ResponseExample>
```json

```
</ResponseExample>

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string | Always `"ok"` when service is running |
| `service` | string | Service identifier: `"kyc-health"` |
| `check_type` | string | Type of check: `"liveness"` |
| `timestamp` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp of the check |
| `cold_start` | boolean | `true` if this was a cold Lambda start |
| `function_name` | string | AWS Lambda function name |
| `function_version` | string | Lambda function version |
| `request_id` | string | Unique request identifier |

## Status Codes

| Code | Description |

| 200 | Service is healthy and responding |
| 500 | Service is unavailable (should not occur if service is running) |

## Use Cases

### Load Balancer Configuration

Configure your load balancer to poll this endpoint:

```
Health Check URL: /health
Interval: 30 seconds
Timeout: 5 seconds
Healthy Threshold: 2
Unhealthy Threshold: 3
```

### Monitoring Integration

Use this endpoint with monitoring tools:

```bash
# Example monitoring script
while true; do
  response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://dev.kyc.legaltalent.ai/health)
  if [ "$response" != "200" ]; then
    echo "Health check failed: HTTP $response"
    # Send alert
  fi
  sleep 60
done
```

### Deployment Verification

After deploying, verify the service is up:

```bash
curl -f https://dev.kyc.legaltalent.ai/health || echo "Deployment verification failed"
```

## Implementation Notes

- **No Dependencies**: This endpoint does not check S3, DynamoDB, or other external services
- **Fast Response**: Typically responds in < 100ms
- **No Caching**: Each request performs a fresh check
- **Public Access**: No authentication required (by design for monitoring)

If you need to verify external dependencies are working, contact support for access to internal readiness endpoints.
