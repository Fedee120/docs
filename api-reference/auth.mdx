title: 'Authentication'
api: 'Bearer Authentication'
---

All API requests require authentication using Bearer tokens. The token is sent in the `Authorization` header of every request.

## Header Format

All authenticated requests must include the following header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The token can be either:
- **JWT Token**: An ID token from your authentication provider (Cognito)
- **API Key**: A service-to-service API key generated via the auth service

## Token Types

### JWT Tokens (User Authentication)

JWT tokens are issued when users log in through your authentication provider. These tokens are temporary and expire after a set period (typically 1 hour).

**When to use**: Web applications, mobile apps, user-facing integrations

### API Keys (Machine-to-Machine)

API keys are permanent credentials for server-to-server integrations. They are generated via the auth service and associated with a specific role.

**When to use**: Backend services, automated integrations, scheduled jobs

## Example Requests

### Using JWT Token

```bash
curl -X POST https://dev.kyc.legaltalent.ai/kyc \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subject": {"full_name": "John Doe"},
    "list_name": "ofac"
  }'
```

### Using API Key

```bash
curl -X POST https://dev.kyc.legaltalent.ai/kyc \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_a1b2c3d4e5f6..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subject": {"full_name": "John Doe"},
    "list_name": "ofac"
  }'
```

## Token Validation

The authorization service automatically:
- Validates the token format and signature
- Extracts tenant identification from the token
- Verifies required permissions for the requested operation
- Passes tenant context to the backend Lambda functions

You do **not** need to include `tenant_id` in request bodies - it is automatically extracted from your token.

## Permissions

Each token is associated with specific permissions. The required permission varies by endpoint:

| Endpoint | Required Permission |
|----------|-------------------|
| `POST /kyc` | `kyc:create` |
| `GET /kyc/{job_id}` | `kyc:read` |
| `GET /exports/{jobId}` | `kyc:export` |
| `GET /kyc/watchlists` | `watchlist:list` |
| `POST /kyc/watchlists` | `watchlist:create` |
| `GET /kyc/usage` | `usage:read` |
| `POST /kyc/adverse-media` | `kyc:create` |

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "message": "Unauthorized"
}
```

This occurs when:
- The `Authorization` header is missing
- The token format is invalid
- The token has expired (JWT tokens only)

### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "message": "User is not authorized to perform this action"
}
```

This occurs when:
- The token is valid but lacks required permissions
- The token's associated role doesn't grant access to the resource

## Getting API Keys

To generate an API key for machine-to-machine authentication:

1. Contact your account administrator
2. Provide the intended use case and required permissions
3. The API key will be generated with appropriate role-based permissions

For security, API keys should be:
- Stored securely (environment variables, secrets manager)
- Never committed to version control
- Rotated periodically
- Revoked immediately if compromised
