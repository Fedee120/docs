## Get Started

Perform your first compliance check with the KYC API in three simple steps.

### Step 1: Get Your API Credentials

Contact your account administrator to obtain API credentials. You'll receive either:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user" title="JWT Token (for user applications)">
    Temporary tokens issued through your authentication provider (Cognito). Ideal for web applications and mobile apps.
    
    **Validity**: Typically 1 hour  
    **Best for**: User-facing applications, frontend integrations
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="server" title="API Key (for server integrations)">
    Permanent credentials for machine-to-machine integrations.
    
    **Format**: `sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`  
    **Best for**: Backend services, automated integrations, scheduled jobs
    
    <Tip>Store API keys securely in environment variables or secrets manager.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Choose Your Environment

Select the appropriate environment for your needs:

| Environment | URL | Purpose |
|-------------|-----|---------|
| **Staging** | `https://stg.kyc.legaltalent.ai` | Testing and integration |
| **Production** | `https://kyc.legaltalent.ai` | Live operations |

<Note>
  Start with **Staging** for development and testing. Move to **Production** when you're ready to go live.
</Note>

### Step 3: Make Your First Request

Check an entity against the OFAC sanctions list:

```bash
curl -X POST https://stg.kyc.legaltalent.ai/kyc \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subject": {
      "full_name": "John Doe",
      "nationality": "US"
    },
    "list_name": "ofac",
    "search_type": "composite"
  }'
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="check-circle" title="Success Response">
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "result": {
        "is_match": false,
        "list_name": "ofac",
        "match_count": 0,
        "matches": [],
        "processing_time_ms": 850
      },
      "execution_context": {
        "request_id": "abc-123-def",
        "timestamp": "2024-11-22T10:30:00Z"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **No match found** - Entity is clear from OFAC sanctions.
</Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="exclamation-triangle" title="Match Found">
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "result": {
        "is_match": true,
        "list_name": "ofac",
        "match_count": 1,
        "matches": [
          {
            "entity_id": "12345",
            "name": "John Doe",
            "confidence_score": 0.95,
            "match_type": "composite",
            "programs": ["SDGT"]
          }
        ],
        "processing_time_ms": 1250
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Match found** - Entity appears on OFAC sanctions list. Review required.
  </Accordion>
